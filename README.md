# Life Tracker

Some things in life are unpredictable. But just because things are unpredictable, it doesn't mean that we can't make the odds in our favour.   

## Exercise Tracker
Track your exercises, with and without specificity. The importance here is just to note that you have exercised because an **instance of exercise is always better than note.**  

## Meal Tracker
Track your meals, with and without specificity. The importance here is to **eat well**, not too much and not too little.

## Medicine Tracker
Track your medicine intake, you would not want to forget whether you have taken your medicine.

## Habits Tracker
Track the habits you want to develop, with and withou specificity. The importance here is to have partial credits. Not all actions/habits can be always completed, so you should **not sell the attempt at forming a habit short.**
